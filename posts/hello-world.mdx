This is my very first blog post on my personal website. I used the NextJS guide [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to kick start this website. Right now this site is just the end result of that guide, I plan to add new features and improve it over time. Whenever I make a change I will add a new blog post if I feel its worth it.

Other than that, I will also blog about my personal journey in growing as a software engineer.
